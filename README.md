## WeatherJS

App written in pure **JS (ES6)** to catch your current location and provide some basic weather data about it.\
You can, also, grab a location from the map on the right, to view the weather conditions from that area.

You can test it by clicking [here](https://weather.gabrieltinetti.site).\
If the link is down, I hadn't got the money to pay for my EC2 instance :')
